        <h4>
            We are company with +10 years of experience in buying back and selling post-lease/used devices such as smartphones, deskops ald laptops. Top quality at the lowest price. Our story began in 2013 when Colman Walsh founded UXTraining.com, a specialist provider of user experience and design thinking training. Hugely popular, our training arm delivers classroom-based training in cities and companies across Europe and North America.

            In 2017, we established the UX Design Institute, which has a broader remit to deliver in-depth UX education and certification. Our goal is to bridge the global skills gap in UX design, and to provide a career pathway for UX designers.     At their most simple forms, UX design is what makes an interface useful, and UI design is what makes an interface beautiful. For UI, this includes a blend of visual hierarchy and interface elements. To understand what separates a great interface from a good interface, one must understand the UI design is merely just one layer of the entire design process. Perhaps this is why people often get confused with UX and UI.
